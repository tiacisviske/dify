# TCP/IP Protocol Suite: An Overview of Chapters 1-30
 
TCP/IP Protocol Suite is a comprehensive textbook that covers the concepts and protocols of data communications and networking using the TCP/IP model. The book is written by Behrouz Forouzan, a professor of computer science at De Anza College, and is published by McGraw Hill Education. The fourth edition of the book has been updated to reflect the recent changes and developments in the field of TCP/IP.

The book is divided into six parts, each containing several chapters that explain the topics in detail with examples, figures, tables, and exercises. The book also provides PowerPoint slides for each chapter that can be downloaded from the publisher's website. The following is a brief summary of each part and chapter of the book:
 
- Part 1: Introduction and Underlying Technologies
    - Chapter 1: Introduction - This chapter introduces the basic concepts of data communications and networking, such as networks, protocols, standards, layers, interfaces, services, encapsulation, multiplexing, switching, and routing.
    - Chapter 2: The OSI Model and TCP/IP Protocol Suite - This chapter compares and contrasts the OSI model and the TCP/IP model, and describes the functions and protocols of each layer in both models.
    - Chapter 3: Underlying Technologies - This chapter discusses the physical and data link layer technologies that support TCP/IP networks, such as transmission media, signaling methods, error detection and correction, framing methods, flow and error control techniques, Ethernet, wireless LANs, PPP, HDLC, and SLIP.
- Part 2: Network Layer
    - Chapter 4: Introduction to Network Layer - This chapter explains the general functions and principles of the network layer, such as addressing, forwarding, routing algorithms, congestion control, quality of service, internetworking devices, and IPv4 packet format.
    - Chapter 5: IPv4 Addresses - This chapter covers the structure and types of IPv4 addresses, such as classful and classless addressing schemes, subnetting and supernetting techniques, address resolution protocol (ARP), reverse address resolution protocol (RARP), dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), and network address translation (NAT).
    - Chapter 6: Delivery, Forwarding, and Routing of IPv4 Packets - This chapter describes how IPv4 packets are delivered from source to destination across multiple networks using forwarding tables and routing protocols. It also discusses various routing techniques and algorithms, such as static vs. dynamic routing, distance vector vs. link state routing, interior vs. exterior routing protocols,
      RIP vs. OSPF vs. BGP.
- Part 3: Transport Layer
    - Chapter 7: Introduction to Transport Layer - This chapter introduces the general functions and principles of the transport layer,
      such as process-to-process communication,
      port numbers,
      connection-oriented vs. connectionless services,
      reliable vs. unreliable delivery,
      flow control,
      congestion control,
      multiplexing,
      demultiplexing,
      socket programming,
      UDP datagram format.
    - Chapter 8: User Datagram Protocol (UDP) - This chapter explains the features and limitations of UDP,
      such as simplicity,
      statelessness,
      checksum,
      fragmentation,
      reassembly,
      applications that use UDP.
    - Chapter 9: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) - This chapter describes the features and mechanisms of TCP,
      such as connection establishment,
      termination,
      sliding window protocol,
      error control,
      congestion control,
      timers,
      options,
      TCP segment format.
    - Chapter 10: Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) - This chapter introduces a new transport layer protocol called SCTP that provides reliable message-oriented service with multiple streams and multiple homing features. It also discusses SCTP packet format,
      association establishment,
      termination,
      data transfer,
      flow control,
      error control,
      congestion control.
- Part 4: Application Layer
    - Chapter 11: Introduction to Application 0f148eb4a0
